# Auto Theme for Feedly

Previously, you could set Feedly to have a dark or light theme, but not to have it match your operating system dark/light theme.  This extension would match your Feedly theme to your system theme.

**This extension is now obsolete due to Feedly adding the “System Preference” option under Appearance settings:**
